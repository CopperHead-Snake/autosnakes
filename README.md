# Snake Competition
Welcome to Snake Game Competetion 

## Outcomes of the Competition 

- Self Oragnizing Teams 
- Improve Coding Best practices 
- Learning Git Flow
- Learning Python 

## Strech Goals 
- Using Micro Services 
- APIs 
- Machines Learning Libraries 


## Code Base 
The code based is comprised of two python files 

snake_core.py : This is the code base code for the game and main game loop resides here. 
                Teams can modify the code core to improve it although it will be subject to approval 


teams.py      : This file contains basic AI code for players 
                Team members can replicate the sample functions and name them with thier own team name 
                e.g Team "avengers" can call their funtion avengers and then use it 

The game will pass basic enviornment information to your function. 
your function should return only one variable telling the game the direction your snake should move. 

## How to contribute

2) Add your own team function in the teams.py - You can duplicate the sample alpha or beta functions 
3) Work locally and commit the code to your branch end of day every day
4) Share the out come in your team meetings with team members 
5) When ready you can choose the name of team to play against in the snake_core.py code line 10 and 11 
6) When ready to compete create a pull request for the moderators to pull in your code.
