- Learning Git Flow
- Learning Python 

## Strech Goals 
- Using Micro Services 
- APIs 
- Machines Learning Libraries 


## Code Base 
The code based is comprised of two python files 

snake_core.py : This is the code base code for the game and main game loop resides here. 
                Teams can modify the code core to improve it although it will be subject to approval 


teams.py      : This file contains basic AI code for players
